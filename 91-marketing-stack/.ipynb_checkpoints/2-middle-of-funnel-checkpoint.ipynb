    "The middle of the funnel is where *lead nurturing* occurs.  And this is where once users arrive on the website, we then try to move them towards a purchase.\n",

    "3. Email Marketing \n",

    "* Website Marketing and Product Trials\n",
    "In website marketing and trial of the product, customers are directly interacting with the website.  In both cases, we may want to identify what items are popular, and when users begin to churn -- by churn we mean disengage from the product.  We can use product analytics tools like Mixpanel, or Amplitude, to identify what links users click on, the sequence of clicks, and also to help us to create dashboards displaying user engagement, and churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now tools like Mixpanel and Amplitude will identify users through identifiers in their browser - and this is helpful to identify if a user is returns over multiple sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Email Marketing \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's even more helpful if we get the email address of a user.  This can allow to engage in email marketing, and use tools like *Marketo* or *ActiveCampaign* or *Customer.io* to follow up with users and send marketing emails.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Remarketing/Retargeting\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it may often be the case that interested users will visit a website, and then simply forget to return.  To remind users of our product, we can use [Facebook pixels](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/144576119557578?id=1913105122334058), or [Google Pixels](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_uk/home/resources/retargeting-ads/).  Using these tools, Google/Facebook will identify users who visited our website, and then send ads to these users over the following days in hopes that the user re-engages."
